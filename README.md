# script-examples
Script examples for the Mango backend (not UI module!) script engine. You will need Mango 3.8.x development version to run these scripts.

## Running the scripts
Save the script file into a file store. When you edit the file you will see a button at the top which you can click to run the file using the selected script engine. A popup dialog will appear and show you the result of running the script.
