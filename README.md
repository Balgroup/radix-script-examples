# script-examples
Script examples for the Mango backend (not UI module!) script engine. You will need Mango 3.8.x development version to run these scripts.

## Running the scripts
Save the script file into a file store. When you edit the file you will see a button at the top which you can click to run the file using the selected script engine. A popup dialog will appear and show you the result of running the script.

## Script event handler
You can use a script as an event handler. Choose the "Script" event handler type. Check the [event handler example](event_handler.js) for details on how to implement the event handler.
